# FastMCP Docs Lookup Patterns

Use these search prompts with the `fastmcp_docs` MCP server for current implementation details.

## General bootstrapping

- `FastMCP quickstart server example`
- `FastMCP project structure best practices`

## MCP primitive design

- `FastMCP tools resources prompts best practices`
- `FastMCP tool schema guidance`

## Conversion and integration

- `FastMCP from OpenAPI`
- `FastMCP from FastAPI`
- `FastMCP RouteMap`
- `FastMCP Transform`

## Validation and deployment

- `FastMCP inspect command`
- `FastMCP deployment options`

## How to apply results

- Prefer official examples for syntax-sensitive code.
- When docs conflict with local assumptions, follow docs and note the update.
- Keep bootstrap defaults stable; treat advanced mapping as a second pass.
