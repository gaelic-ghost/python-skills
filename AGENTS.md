## Repository Policy

- This repository (`/Users/galew/Workspace/python-skills`) is the source of truth for skill development.
- Do all skill authoring, refactoring, testing, and maintenance only in this repository.
- Treat managed production skills at `~/.agents/skills` as read-only deployment artifacts.
- Never edit files under `~/.agents/skills` directly; make changes here and promote through the normal sync/release flow.
